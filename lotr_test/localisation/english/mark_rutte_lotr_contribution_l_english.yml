####ANDUIN EVENTS
anduin.1d:0 "Welcome to the Vales! Between the Misty Mountains and Mirkwood, ours is a beautiful land. The Beornings, young and old, Woodsmen, Stoors, and Éothéod live here side-by-side. You have two modifiers. The Stoors of Ninglor and the Lower Anduin Vale are basically autonomous and do not partake in the dealings outside of their towns.
